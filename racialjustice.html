            Overview
        </h3>
        <p>
            NTCE is in the midst of total transformation as we realign our organization
             toward racial justice, inside and out. We would like to acknowledge the ways
              that we have participated in racism, anti-Blackness, and other forms of oppression
               through our workplace policies and culture. Over the years, these conditions harmed
                our staff in innumerable ways. We received a serious wake-up call when in 2019 many
                NTCE staff left the organization in response to the harm they experienced.  
                 Since then, we have been working to examine how we got here and how we can
                  create an organization that supports all of our employees to thrive. We are deeply
                   committed to transformation and invite our community to hold us accountable in this crucial work. 
                   A previous version of this page was written in 2020 in an effort to be transparent about
                    what happened and what we’re doing make it right. Now, in January 2022,
                     we are offering an updated statement. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-primary">
            What Happened
        </h3>
        <p>
            In 2019, a large number of our staff walked out of the office in protest
            of what they felt was an “unequal workplace.” The incident was widely
             reported in the news, including The New York Times and Jezebel. Several 
             former staff wrote an open letter published in Out Magazine outlining the
              issues they faced and why they left. Over 400 LGBTQ activists, organizers, 
              and community members also signed an open letter in support of those former
               employees. That year, our staff went from 21 to just seven. 
               In addition to these news stories and feedback from former and current staff,
                we hired a Black feminist consulting firm that specializes in racial justice 
                in the nonprofit sector to conduct a third-party assessment of the organization.
                 They interviewed current and former staff, current and former board members,
                  and community leaders. 
                  For many years, NCTE has experienced high staff turnover, especially for staff of color.
                   Our staff quadrupled in size in just a few years, but the organization’s culture
                    and structures did not offer enough support to the new staff who were all hired
                     into high-pressure jobs. The firm found a culture of white dominance as well
                      as inadequate structures and policies to support NCTE’s staff.

            What We’re Doing 
        </h3>
        <p>
            We know that the best apology is changed behavior. To that end, we are working to change
             the culture and policies of our organization so that all staff can thrive. 
             Starting in 2020, NCTE began a series of trainings and discussions about race, power,
              privilege, and equity. Executive leadership also began receiving coaching on how to 
              address these dynamics in the organization. Most recently, in the fall of 2021,
               we conducted a series of four three-day staff retreats facilitated by consultants 
               as well as staff to discuss organizational culture, race, and NCTE's future. We are 
               specifically examining anti-Black racism because we understand that centering the most
                marginalized among us will lead to a better world for all of us. We have examined and
                 will continue to examine how anti-Blackness shows up in our workplace, how our culture
                  of overworking contributes to burnout, and how white dominant culture impacts the organization
                   overall.  These conversations have been both eye-opening and uncomfortable, as they should be,
                    and we believe we are becoming better because of it. As we recognize the patterns, 
                    we have begun to explore what it could look like to tangibly transform.

            New Leadership and Vision 
        </h3>
        <p>
            Our staff has grown significantly since the end of 2019. All of us believe
             in NCTE’s commitment to change and continue to make contributions to improving
              racial justice in the workplace. We are excited, but most of all grateful,
               to be working together as a team of ambitious and passionate activists.  
               In addition to hiring new staff, we are very excited to have new leadership.
                As our previous leader of 18 years departed, Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen was promoted 
                to Executive Director. Rodrigo came with a new vision for the organization that 
                puts equitable workplace practices at the forefront and pushes NCTE into a new era
                 of radical change. Rodrigo is enthusiastic about NCTE’s shift to becoming an organization
                  that all trans people can be a part of and want to join. Through ongoing and sustained relationship
                   building with other trans organizations led by trans people of color, NCTE will see these aspirations come to fruition.

        <h3 class="text-primary">
            Accountability 
        </h3>
        <p>
            As we work toward justice and a better NCTE, we know that it will take time to reestablish trust.
             This is a process that requires our engagement of the community’s needs, especially of those who
              have been harmed by our actions and inactions. It is important that our efforts are informed by
               what the community deems necessary for rebuilding trust. We are looking forward to having the
                opportunity to discuss with community members what accountability looks like for them. After all,
                 the integral principle that guides us in this endeavor is that we owe it to our community to do better. 
                 We will continue to update this webpage as we progress, learn, and evolve in our understanding of how to
                  embody racial justice in every aspect of our work.
