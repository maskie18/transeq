                <p>
                    Federal and state laws - and, in many cases, the U.S. Constitution - prohibit discrimination
                     in health care and insurance because you're transgender. That means that health plans aren’t 
                     allowed to exclude transition-related care, and health care providers are required to treat
                      you with respect and according to your gender identity.

            What are my rights in insurance coverage?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Federal and state law prohibits most public and private health plans from discriminating against you because you are transgender.
             <strong>
                This means, with few exceptions, that it is illegal discrimination for your health insurance plan to refuse to cover medically
              necessary transition-related care.
             </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some examples of illegal discrimination in insurance:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Health plans can’t have automatic or categorical exclusions of transition-related care.</strong>
                 For example, a health plan that says that all care related to gender transition is excluded violates the law.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Health plans can’t have a categorical exclusion of a specific transition-related procedure.</strong> 
                Excluding from coverage specific medically necessary procedures that some transgender people need is discrimination.
                 For example, a health plan should not categorically exclude all coverage for facial feminization
                  surgery or impose arbitrary age limits that contradict medical standards of care.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>An insurance company can’t place limits on coverage for transition-related care if those limits are discriminatory.</strong>
                 For example, an insurance company can’t automatically exclude a specific type of procedure if it covers that procedure
                  for non-transgender people. For example, if a plan covers breast reconstruction for cancer treatment, or hormones
                   to treat post-menopause symptoms, it cannot exclude these procedures to treat gender dysphoria.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Refusing to enroll you in a plan, cancelling your coverage, or charging higher rates because of your transgender status:</strong>
                 An insurance company can’t treat you differently, refuse to enroll you, or limit coverage for any services because you are transgender.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Denying coverage for care typically associated with one gender:</strong> It’s illegal for an
                 insurance company to deny you coverage for treatments typically associated with one gender based on
                  the gender listed in the insurance company’s records or the sex you were assigned at birth. For example,
                   if a transgender woman’s health care provider decides she needs a prostate exam, an insurance company can’t deny 
                   it because she is listed as female in her records. If her provider recommends gynecological care, coverage 
                   can’t be denied simply because she was identified as male at birth.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Does private health insurance cover transition-related care?</h5>
        <p>
            It is illegal for most private insurance plans to deny coverage for medically necessary transition-related care.
             Your private insurance plan should provide coverage for the care that you need. However, many transgender
              people continue to face discriminatory denials.
        </p>
     </div>

     <div class="container">
        <h5>Does Medicaid cover transition-related care?</h5>
        <p>
            It is illegal for Medicaid plans to deny coverage for medically necessary transition-related care.
             Your state Medicaid plan should provide coverage for the care that you need. However,
              many transgender people continue to face discriminatory denials. Some states have specific guidelines
               on the steps you have to take to access care.
        </p>
     </div>

     <div class="container">
        <h5>My plan has an exclusion for transition-related care. What should I do?</h5>
        <p>
            There are many reasons why your plan might still have an exclusion for transition-related care in general
             or for a specific procedure. This does not mean that your plan will not cover your care. Sometimes plan
              documents are out of date, or you can ask for an exception by showing that this care is medically necessary for you.

            Does Medicare cover transition-related care?
        </h5>
        <p>
            It is illegal for Medicare to deny coverage for medically necessary transition-related care.
        </p>
        <p>
            For many years, Medicare did not cover transition-related surgery due to a decades-old policy
             that categorized such treatment as "experimental." That exclusion was eliminated in May 2014,
              and there is now no national exclusion for transition-related health care under Medicare. 
              Some local Medicare contractors have specific policies spelling out their coverage for transition-related 
              care, as do some private Medicare Advantage plans.

        <h5>
            Does the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provide transition-related care?
        </h5>
        <p>
            The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides coverage for some transition-related care for eligible veterans.
             However, VHA still has an arbitrary and medically baseless exclusion for coverage of transition-related surgery. 
              On June 19th, The US Department of Veterans Affairs announced that they will begin the process to expand 
              health care services available to transgender veterans to include gender confirmation surgery. Currently,
               the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides care for thousands of transgender veterans, including
                some transition-related medical care. We expect the rule will finalize in approximately two years.

            TRICARE provides coverage for some transition-related care for family members and dependents
             of military personnel. However, TRICARE still has an exclusion for coverage of transition-related surgery.

        <h5>What are my rights related to privacy of my health information?</h5>
        <p>
            The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires most health care providers
             and health insurance plans to protect your privacy when it comes to certain information about your
              health or medical history. Information about your transgender status, including your diagnosis,
               medical history, sex assigned at birth, or anatomy, may be protected health information.
                Such information should not be disclosed to anyone—including family, friends, and other 
                patients—without your consent. This information should also not be disclosed to medical 
                staff unless there is a medically relevant reason to do so. If this information is shared for purposes
                 of gossip or harassment, it is a violation of HIPAA.

        <h5>Seek preauthorization for care and appeal insurance denials</h5>
        <p>
            You shouldn’t be denied the care that you need just because you’re transgender. That's illegal.
        </p>
        <p>
            To access transition-related care, we recommend applying for preauthorization before any procedures to understand whether
             your plan will cover it. You should also consider appealing insurance denials that you believe are discriminatory.
             <strong>We recommend you consult an attorney before filing any appeals.</strong>

     <div class="container">
        <h5>Contact an attorney or legal organization</h5>
        <p>
            If you face discrimination from a health care provider or insurance company, it may be against the law.
             You can talk to a lawyer or a legal organization to see what your options are. A lawyer might also be able
              to help you resolve your problem without a lawsuit, for example by contacting your health care provider
               to make sure they understand their legal obligations or filing a complaint with a professional board.
        </p>

        <h5>File discrimination complaints with state and federal agencies</h5>
        <p>
            Now transgender people are encouraged to report any discrimination they experience while seeking health care services.
             The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has encouraged consumers who believed that a covered entity
              violated their civil rights may file a complaint. If you face any of ther kind of discrimination or
               denial of care based on your gender, disability, age, race, or national origin, or if your health care 
               privacy was violated, you can still file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
                Office for Civil Rights.

        <h5>Federal protections</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>The Health Care Rights Law, as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)</strong> prohibits sex discrimination, 
                including anti-transgender discrimination, by most health providers and insurance companies, as well as discrimination
                 based on race, national origin, age, and disability. Under the ACA, it is illegal for most insurance companies to
                  have exclusions of transition-related care, and it is illegal for most health providers to discriminate against
                   transgender people, like by turning someone away or refusing to treat them according to their gender identity.
                    On May 5th, 2021, the Biden Administration and HHS announced that the Office for Civil Rights will interpret
                     and enforce Section 1557 and Title IX’s prohibitions on discrimination based on sex to include: 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</li>
            <li>Discrimination on the basis of gender identity.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Section 1557 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex,
             age, or disability in covered health programs or activities.  The update was made in light of the U.S.
              Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County and subsequent court decisions. Now transgender
               people are encouraged to report any discrimination they experience while seeking health care services.
                The HHS has encouraged consumers who believed that a covered entity violated their civil rights may 
                file a complaint at: https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/complaints

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</strong> protects patients’ privacy
                 when it comes to certain health information, including information related to a person’s transgender status 
                 and transition. It also gives patients the right to access, inspect, and copy their protected health 
                 information held by hospitals, clinics, and health plans.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Americans with Disabilities Act</strong> prohibits discrimination in health care and other settings based
                 on a disability, which may include a diagnosis of gender dyshoria.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Medicare and Medicaid regulations</strong> protect the right of hospital patients to choose their
                 own visitors and medical decision-makers regardless of their legal relationship to the patient.
                  This means that hospitals cannot discriminate against LGBT people or their families in visitation
                   and in recognizing a patient’s designated decision-maker.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong> The Joint Commission hospital accreditation standards</strong> require hospitals to have internal 
               policies prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong> The Nursing Home Reform Act</strong> establishes a set of nursing home residents’ rights that include 
               the right to privacy, including in visits from friends or loved ones; the right to be free from abuse, mistreatment,
                and neglect; the right to choose your physician; the right to dignity and self-determination; and the right to 
                file grievances without retaliation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
           <strong> State and local nondiscrimination laws</strong> prohibit health care discrimination against transgender people in many circumstances.
