        <h3>Supporting the Transgender People in Your Life: A Guide to Being a Good Ally</h3>

      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <p>
            Learning to be an ally to the transgender people in your life, or to transgender people overall,
             is an ongoing process. Some ways to be a good ally are simple and easy, while others require more
              time, energy, and commitment. Whether you’re looking for information on supporting a transgender
               person in your life or helping to change the world to be better for transgender people overall,
                this guide can help.One of the most important parts of being an ally to transgender people is
                 learning what it means to be transgender. For information on identity, language, and other
                  issues facing transgender people you can visit Frequently Asked Questions about Transgender
                   People, Understanding Non-Binary People, and our About Transgender People hub, which has 
                   links to various resources and educational material.

        <h3 class="text-primary">The Basics: Things to Remember about Being an Ally</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>There is no one way to be a ‘perfect’ ally.</strong> The transgender community is diverse and 
            complex, coming from every region of the United States and around the world, from every racial and
             ethnic background, and from every faith community. This means that different members of the transgender
              community have different needs and priorities. Similarly, there is no one right way to handle every 
              situation, or interact with every trans person. Be respectful, do your best, and keep trying.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>You don’t have to understand someone’s identity to respect it.</strong> Some people haven’t 
            heard a lot about transgender identity, or have trouble understanding what it means to be trans,
             and that’s okay. But all people, even those whose identities you don’t fully understand, deserve respect.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>You can’t always tell if someone is transgender simply by looking at them.</strong> Many people
             expect that they’ll “just know” when someone is trans, and may be surprised to learn that this isn’t
              always true. Since there is no one transgender experience, there is no one way for transgender people
               to look, either. Trans people might be in groups or gatherings alongside you without you realizing
                that we’re there – which makes it even more important to be an outspoken ally and supporter,
                 whether or not you are aware of any trans people around you. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>There is no “one right way” to be transgender.</strong> Some transgender people choose to 
            medically transition, and some don’t. Some transgender people choose to legally change their names
             or ID documents, and some don’t. Some transgender people choose to change their appearance
              (like their clothing or hair), and some don’t. Likewise, some transgender people may want
               to do many of those things but are unable to because they can’t afford it or for safety reasons.
               A transgender person’s identity does not depend on what things they have or haven’t done to transition,
                and no two transgender people’s journeys are exactly alike.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Continue to educate yourself.</strong> One of the simplest ways to be a strong ally is to take your
             education into your own hands. It’s important to have conversations with the trans people
              in your life, but it’s also important for you to seek out resources and information on your own.
               A few great places to start:

            Interacting with Transgender People
        </h3>
        <p>
            This section includes information on respectfully interacting with transgender individuals one-on-one or when in a small group.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Use the language a transgender person uses for themselves.</strong> No two transgender people are exactly the same,
             and different transgender people may use different words to describe themselves. You should follow the lead of each
              trans person, as they will best know the language that is right for them.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>If you don’t know what pronouns to use, ask.</strong> A simple way to see what pronouns someone uses—he,
             she, they, or something else—is to wait and see if it comes up naturally in conversation. If you’re still unsure,
              ask politely and respectfully, without making a big deal about it. Sharing your own pronouns is a great way to
               bring up the topic—for example, “Hi, I’m Rebecca and I use she/her/hers as my pronouns. How about you?” 
               If you accidentally use the wrong pronouns, apologize and move on. Making a big deal out of a pronoun 
               mistake may be awkward and often draws unwanted attention to the transgender person.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Be careful and considerate about what other questions you ask.</strong> There are many topics—medical
             transition, life pre-transition, sexual activity—that you may be curious about. That doesn’t mean it’s 
             appropriate to ask a transgender person about them, or expect a transgender person to be comfortable sharing 
             intimate details about themselves. There are two questions you can ask yourself that may help determine 
             if a topic is appropriate to bring up:
        </p>
        <p>
            “Do I need to know this information to treat them respectfully?” Asking someone’s name and pronoun
             is almost always appropriate, as we use that information in talking to and about each other every
              day. Beyond that, though, you may be curious about questions that are not things you truly need
               to know. For example, a transgender coworker’s surgical history is rarely information that you
                need to know.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Would I be comfortable if this question was turned around and asked of me?” Another good way
             to determine if a question is appropriate is to think about how it would feel if someone
              asked you something similar. For example, it would probably not feel appropriate for a coworker
               to ask you about your private areas of your body. Likewise, it’s probably not appropriate to 
               ask similar questions about a transgender coworker’s body.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some specific topics that many transgender people are uncomfortable discussing with anyone but those closest to them:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                “You look like a real woman! I never would have known that you’re trans.”
            </li>
            <li>
                “You would look less trans if you just got a wig/shaved better/wore more makeup/etc.”
            </li>
            <li>
                “No real man would wear clothing like that. You should change if you don’t want people to know you’re transgender.”
            </li>
            <li>
                “I’d date him, even though he’s transgender.”
            </li>

        <h3 class="text-primary">Being Outspoken</h3>
        <p>
            Here's how to be an outspoken ally in larger groups, at work or at school!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Speak out in support of transgender people and transgender rights.</strong> Politely correct others 
            if they use the wrong name or pronoun for a transgender person. More broadly, it is important to challenge 
            anti-transgender remarks, jokes, and conversations. It can be scary to speak out, but loud and visible support 
            for transgender rights can show transgender people that they are accepted, encourage other allies to speak out,
             and help change the minds of people who aren’t supportive of transgender people yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Support transgender people who experience discrimination.</strong> Transgender people may feel that
             they don’t have support from others when making complaints about discrimination or bringing their experiences 
             to authorities, administrators, or others in position of power. Make it clear that you will support the transgender
              people in your life whether or not they decide to make formal complaints.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Think about how you use gendered language.</strong> Do you regularly greet groups by saying,
             “Ladies and gentlemen?” Do you have a coworker who refers to everyone as “guys?” Is there a particular 
             gender-based joke your friend loves to tell? Many transgender people are fine being called ‘ladies’ or
              ‘gentlemen,’ but you can’t know without first asking. Consider changing your habits to avoid making assumptions 
              about people's gender or pronouns, and encouraging the people in your life to do the same. This can take time and 
              effort, but is an important way to be an ally and support transgender people outside of individual, 
              face-to-face interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong> Learn about policies affecting transgender people.</strong> Are there any laws that protect transgender
            people where you live? Any policies at work or school that are inclusive of transgender people? It’s important to 
            learn more about the challenges that transgender people face and the goals of transgender advocates, and,
             if you’re comfortable with it, even help push to change bad laws and policies or support good ones.

        <h3 class="text-primary">Changing Businesses, Schools, and More</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Rethink gender on forms and documents.</strong> When creating forms and documents,
             consider whether you need to include gender at all. Many times, we default to asking for gender without
              considering why or how that information will be used. If you do need to ask for gender information, consider
               using a blank space for people to fill in as they feel comfortable, rather than a boxes marked “male” and “female,”
                or make it clear that people can fill in forms in a way that matches their gender identity.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Ensure everyone has access to bathrooms and other facilities.</strong> Everyone should be able to safely
             and comfortably use bathrooms and other gendered facilities. Push to allow people to use the bathroom that matches
              their gender identity rather than what’s on their ID. In addition, providing gender-neutral or private bathrooms
               is a great way to provide safe and comfortable space for everyone (but never require anyone to use them if they
                don’t want!). And if a restroom is designed for just one user at a time, make sure that it’s gender-neutral—there’s 
                no reason to make it a men’s or women’s restroom. Take down that “Women” or “Men” sign and put up new signs
                 that say “Restroom.”
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong> Push for support and inclusivity, not just "tolerance."</strong> A baseline of tolerance—allowing transgender 
           people to exist—is an important start, but we can do more. If your school brings outside speakers or hosts events, 
           make sure that some of them include transgender people and topics. If your business donates to nonprofits, look into
            partnering with organizations that support the transgender community. If your organization posts community events on
             social media, include some from the transgender community.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Craft a transgender-inclusive nondiscrimination policy.</strong> Shifting the culture of an organization
             takes time. Crafting a transgender-inclusive nondiscrimination policy can help clarify how your organization 
             supports transgender people, and ensure that there’s a way to respond to those who aren’t supportive.

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Show up in your community.</strong> School board meetings, library councils, parent-teacher associations,
             volunteer groups – all of these can have an enormous impact on the everyday lives of trans people. Recently,
              schools and libraries have come under attack even just for acknowledging that transgender people exist. In these spaces,
               making it clear that you support trans people can be enormously impactful.

             in employment, housing, public accommodations (public spaces like stores and parks), and education based on
              gender identity/expression. This could be as simple as calling your elected officials, or as involved as a 
              letter-writing campaign or collecting signatures for a ballot measure.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Change the curriculum</strong> of medical, health, crisis response and social work programs,
             or bring in trainers, to teach these providers about transgender people and how to treat transgender 
             people with respect and professionalism. Include information about the rejection, discrimination and violence 
             that transgender people face and how to provide services and support to transgender clients.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Work with schools</strong> to make them safe for transgender students by implementing all the 
            recommendations in our Model School District Policy on Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming Students.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Work with homeless shelters</strong> to make them safe for transgender people by implementing all
             the recommendations in Transitioning Our Shelters: A Guide to Making Homeless Shelters Safe for Transgender People.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Work with suicide prevention, HIV prevention and treatment, alcohol and drug abuse treatment, and anti-smoking programs</strong> 
            to ensure that their work is trans-inclusive and their staff is knowledgeable about transgender issues. Find trainers
             and teach them how to deal sensitively with trans people seeking assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Work with police departments</strong> to have fair written policies with regard to interacting with
             transgender members of the public, regardless if they are seeking assistance or being arrested, and make 
             sure all police officers are trained on following the policy and treating transgender people with respect.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Work with jail and prison systems</strong> to ensure the respectful and safe treatment of transgender
             prisoners, starting with implementing the recommendations of Standing with LGBT Prisoners.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Center diversity.</strong> Transgender people come from every population, and are of all races,
             religions, ages, and more. There are transgender immigrants, employees, prisoners, sex workers,
              and every other category imaginable. Make an effort to be as inclusive as possible of all kinds 
              of transgender people when working to support transgender communities.

            Hopefully by this point you feel armed with the tools and knowledge needed to be an ally to the
             transgender people in your life, as well as the larger transgender community. Remember: nobody's
              perfect. No one person could ever be the perfect ally at all times, so it’s just important to provide
               as much support as you can and to learn from the mistakes you may make along the way.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for being a strong ally!</p>
