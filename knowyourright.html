            What are Public Accommodations?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Public accommodations are establishments that provide goods and services to the general 
            public – which may include (for example) restaurants, theaters, hotels, hospitals, libraries, 
            gas stations, and retail stores. State and federal civil rights laws prohibit covered businesses
             from discriminating against customers on some grounds, but the range of businesses covered by law varies.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="text-primary">What Laws Protect Me in Public Accommodations?</h3>
        <p>
            Federal nondiscrimination laws covering public accommodations cover only race,
             color, religion, national origin, and disability. Federal law does not prohibit 
             discrimination based on sex, gender identity or sexual orientation in public accommodations. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The majority of states (44 and the District of Columbia) prohibit discrimination based on sex 
            in public accommodations. Many state courts and enforcement agencies have interpreted
             these laws to protect transgender people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many states and localities also explicitly prohibit discrimination based on gender
             identity and sexual orientation in public accommodations. The following 17 states 
             have explicit protections: California, Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, 
             Iowa, Maryland, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island,
              Vermont, and Washington State, as well as the District of Columbia. More than 200 cities
               and counties also explicitly prohibit gender identity discrimination even if
                their state does not.
        </p>
        <p>
            Businesses that are public accommodations may also be covered by other civil rights laws.
             For example, while the customers of a restaurant are covered by laws regarding public
              accommodations, the restaurant’s employees are covered by laws regarding employment.
               A hospital may be covered by laws specifically covering health care as well as 
               those covering public accommodations.

        <h3 class="text-primary">What Are My Rights in Public Accommodations?</h3>
        <p>
            Most states and many cities prohibit discrimination in public accommodations based
             on either sex or gender identity. <strong>If your state or locality has such a law, you have the following rights:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>You have the right to not to be refused entry, participation, or services because you are transgender or gender nonconforming. </strong>
            You have the right to enjoy a business’s services or goods on an equal basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>You have the right to dress and present yourself in a manner consistent with your gender identity.</strong>
             You cannot be turned away because someone objects to your gender presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong> You have the right to be free from harassment.</strong> If the business’s management knows of serious 
           harassment by staff or customers and fails to remedy it, this may be discrimination.

            What About Public Restrooms?
        </h3>
        <p>
            People sometimes think that “public accommodations” refers to public restrooms. Actually, 
            “public accommodations” are categories of businesses that serve the general public. 
            If a business is covered by a public accommodations law, access to all facilities that are open
             to the public is covered by that law as well. (Similarly, if a business is covered by an
              employment law, then an employee’s access to the restrooms is covered by that law.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Denial of access to a public restroom that is consistent with person’s gender identity may
             be discrimination based on sex and/or gender identity. Many state and local laws, 
             or official interpretations of those laws, explicitly protect this right; however, 
             in a few states the laws have been interpreted not to protect this right. While most
              states currently have no official guidance on this issue, you may file a complaint 
              of discrimination with your state or local human rights agency if you are denied 
              equal access to restrooms.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-primary">What Can I Do if I Face Discrimination in Public Accommodations?</h3>
        <p>
            The first step is determining whether your state or locality covers sex or gender identity
             discrimination in the type of establishment that engaged in the discrimination.
              This information may be available on the state or local human rights agency’s website,
               or you may have to look up the law online. (See the chart below for citations to state laws.)  
        </p>
        <p>
            Complaint procedures vary. Some states and cities have a standard complaint form, while 
            others do not. Unless you know that your jurisdiction explicitly prohibits discrimination
             based on gender identity, you should specify that your complaint alleges sex discrimination.
              Most agencies have deadlines for filing complaints – these vary by jurisdiction, 
              but may be as short as 60 days. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Your complaint will be more effective if you can present solid facts. Write down the date,
             time, location, witnesses, and people involved in any events that were discriminatory 
             or disrespectful. Also keep any documents that the discriminating entity gives you.
              If you present your situation in an organized way, you increase the chance of 
              your complaint getting the attention it deserves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the agency receives your complaint, they may contact you to discuss your situation.
             In some cases, the agency may ask you and the business that is the subject of the
              complaint to participate in voluntary mediation. If a complaint cannot be resolved 
              voluntarily, the agency will usually investigate it and make a finding as to whether
               discrimination occurred and, if so, what corrective action the business must take.
                In some jurisdictions you may have a right to file a lawsuit – either immediately
                or after an investigation by the agency – however the available remedies may be 
                limited, for example to a court order preventing the business from discriminating
                 in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            For discrimination in housing, health care, credit or loans, education, employment,
             or air travel, you may file a sex discrimination complaint under federal law.
              See NCTE’s other Know Your Rights resources for details.

            Every jurisdiction is different, and this guide is only a general overview. Specific 
            information about state and local laws can be obtained from your state or local human 
            rights agency or local community groups. While complaints can be filed and often resolved 
            without an attorney, don’t hesitate to seek help from a local community group or an attorney,
             or both.

             so we can use it in our advocacy efforts to change policies, improve education, and reduce
