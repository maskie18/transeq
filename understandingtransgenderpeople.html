                    Understanding what it is like to be transgender can be hard, especially if you have never met a transgender person.
                    <strong>Transgender</strong> is a broad term that can be used to describe people whose gender identity is different 
                    from the gender they were thought to be when they were born. “Trans” is often used as shorthand for transgender.
                    To treat a transgender person with respect, you treat them according to their gender identity, not their sex at birth.
                     So, someone who lives as a woman today is called a <strong>transgender woman</strong> and should be referred to as “she”
                      and “her.” A <strong>transgender man</strong> lives as a man today and should be referred to as “he” and “him.”
                      (Note: NCTE uses both the adjectives “male” and “female” and the nouns “man” and “woman” to refer to a person’s gender identity.)
                      <strong>Gender identity</strong> is your internal knowledge of your gender – for example, your knowledge that you’re a man,
                       a woman, or another gender. <strong>Gender expression</strong> is how a person presents their gender on the outside.
                       That might include behavior, clothing, hairstyle, voice or body characteristics. Everyone has a gender identity,
                        including cisgender – or non-transgender – people. If someone’s gender identity matches the gender they were assigned
                         at birth, then they are cisgender, or “cis" for short. 
                         <strong>Sex</strong> is often used in a medical or scientific contexts. Sex is a label — male or female
                          — that you’re assigned by a doctor at birth based on the appearance of the genitals you’re born with.
                           It doesn’t define who you are, or what your gender identity might turn out to be. 
                           When a person begins to live according to their gender identity, rather than the gender they were thought to be
                            when they were born, this time period is called <strong>gender transition</strong>. Deciding to transition can take a lot of reflection.
                             Many transgender people risk social stigma, discrimination, and harassment when they tell other people who they really are.
                              Despite those risks, being open about one’s gender identity can be life-affirming and even life-saving.Possible steps
                               in a <strong>gender transition</strong> may or may not include changing your clothing, appearance, name, or the pronoun people use to
                                refer to you (like “she,” “he,” or “they”). If they can, some people change their identification documents, like their driver’s
                                 license or passport, to better reflect their gender. And some people undergo hormone therapy or other medical procedures
                                  to change their physical characteristics and make their body match the gender they know themselves to be.
                                   All transgender people are entitled to the same dignity and respect, regardless of whether or not they have been
                                    able to take any legal or medical steps.Some transgender people identify as neither a man nor a woman,
                                     or as a combination of male and female, and may use terms like <strong>nonbinary</strong> or <strong>genderqueer</strong> to 
                                     describe their gender identity.
                                      Those who are nonbinary often prefer to be referred to as “they” and “them.”It is important to use
                                       respectful terminology, and treat transgender people as you would treat any other person.
                                        This includes using the name the person has asked you to call them (not their old name)
                                         as well as the pronouns they want you to use. If you aren’t sure what pronouns a person uses,
                                          just ask politely.

                         but I always knew I was a girl. I was so relieved when I told my mom about 
                         how I felt – and instead of being mad, she was supportive." - Grace

                        "Though my birth certificate said female, I have always felt like a boy. 
                        I kept it inside for many years, spending countless sleepless nights being 
                        terrified of what my family and friends would think and worrying about being rejected at school.
                         I finally transitioned to the man I am today when I was 20 years old. Though I have
                          faced discrimination by many people since then, I have also received invaluable support.
                           That is what keeps me going." - Alex
